# Hi, I'm André Persson 👋

I'm a Software Developer currently working at Adtraction. My journey started with PHP and the Symfony framework, sprinkling in some Stimulus for extra flavor. These days, I spend most of my time in the world of Java & Spring, building scalable backend solutions, and React, delivering creative frontend experiences.

### 🛠️ Skills & Experience
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Framework), PHP (Symfony)
- **Frontend:** React, Stimulus
- **Other:** Always open to learning new tools and frameworks!

### ✨ Approach
Minimalistic but creative—solving problems with clean code and a fresh perspective.
